# Show off the app UI (how the app looks)

Welcome to The Cat's Meowchies, our Cat Tinder Application. My name is Eduviges Carrion I had the pleasure of working with my partner Nguyen.  Lets start off by taking a look at the UI. Here we have our home page.  In the top left corner we have our logo "eddie describe cat".  Next lets meet the feline options "click on meet the cats button". Here we have a list of potential cats looking for love. 

As you can see we decieded to go with a Dragonball Z theme.  We have our Cats names displayed with the option to view the Cat's profile.

# Click on cats

# What is one UI feature in which you are proud

We're content with the individial cards. We are really sadisfied with the ability to display a growing list of cats, each one shares the cats personalized information.

# Click on CatIndex

- CatIndex: We're using a .map() method to iteratre over our cat database which allows us to render all current cats and future cats added to dating pool.
# Click on CatShow

- CatShow: In our CatShows page we have an imported card component that allows us to display the cat's personalized information
