# Follow up

Hello Mr. Newman, I recently submitted an application a week ago for the Web Developer position.  I was wondering if you could connect me with someone from the hiring team so I try and follow up with the company.  Hope your having a roaring summer this season!  Thank you

# Why are you interested in Going and this position?

    As a graduate of LEARN academy, I have received over 500 hours of direct coding experience. My knowledge gained at Learn allows me to produce full-stack applications with test-driven development practices using JEST and RSpec. In addition, I have built MVC databases with Ruby on Rails and quality responsive UI with React frameworks. I have also achieved a working knowledge of Functional Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Relational Databases, and best practices for documenting and producing code.  This position will allow for horizontal growth in depth and breath of the skills i've obtained during my studies and internship and will allow be to provide value to the development team.

# Tell us about your involvement in the development process of a previous project. What was your favorite part of the process? What was your least favorite part?
    In my current internship i'm tasked with expediting and supporting development team in progressively updating and upgrading San Diego Startup Map's application from Rails 4.2 --> 7.0.0. I'm managing and parsing through legacy code base and priming development environment for code migrations. Currently working of verifying complete test coverage prior to migration. Post migration I'll be cross examining for deprecated features, GEM dependencies while assuring the product owner's intended application functionality and test coverage stays true to the original design.  My favorite part of the job was helping a  team take an existing product that helps the startup companies maximize their exposure and marketing to potential investment firms.  A challenging aspect of the project was researching and bringing the outdated application to a place of minimum product viability, and then expanding of the capabilities and services that it product owner intends for the application to offer.

# What do you enjoy most about working as a software engineer?
    I enjoy the agile work environment that software engineering offers.  It embodies continual growth and improvement.  This model allows for a development team to actively participate and have practical scaffolding for designing and deployment of products to the customer.  Another aspect that I enjoy. Is the culture mentorship and how with this mindset when a team adopts its fundamentals becomes a force multiplier productivity and problem solving.  A rising tide raises all ships
